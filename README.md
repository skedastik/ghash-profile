# Study

Following are the results of running ghash across a more extensive test sample.

```
Percentage of collisions across all attacks per resolution/fuzziness pair:

                res=8      res=4      res=3     
    ---------+------------------------------
    fuzz=0   |  30.37      68.15      83.70      
    fuzz=5   |  30.37      72.22      81.85      
    fuzz=10  |  38.15      75.56      86.30      

A total of 30 images under 9 attacks were examined.
